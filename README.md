### Steps to Use Firebase Firestore for Real-time Data Management

1. **Set Up Firebase Project:**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Add a web app to your project and copy the Firebase configuration.

2. **Include Firebase SDK:**
   - Add the Firebase SDK scripts to your HTML file to use Firebase services.

3. **Initialize Firebase:**
   - Use the copied Firebase configuration to initialize Firebase in your JavaScript code.

4. **Add Data to Firestore:**
   - Create a form to capture user input.
   - Write JavaScript to submit the form data to a Firestore collection.

5. **Delete Data from Firestore:**
   - Add a button to each item in your list to allow deletion.
   - Write JavaScript to remove the corresponding document from Firestore when the button is clicked.

6. **Set Up Real-time Updates:**
   - Use Firestore's `onSnapshot` method to listen for real-time updates.
   - Write JavaScript to handle changes such as additions and deletions, and update the UI accordingly.
